## Introduction
Propagatorz is a "plant help line" web application that allows users to share photos and notes regarding thier house plants.
Users will need to login or sign up first in order to start taking part in the discussions.
The login functionality also allows users to keep track of all of the posts they created as well.


## User Story
* As a user I want to be able to upload a photo of my plant along with some other information describing the problem. <br/>
* As a user I want other users to be able to comment on my post to give me feedback on what the problem might be (i.e. over-watering). <br/>
* As a user I want to be able to see other userâ€™s posts and leave my own comments. <br/>
* As a user I want to be able to log into my account so that I can create a new post and then filter all the posts so I can just see just my own posts. <br/>
